# Introduction/Main idea
Our project focuses on the Chinese International Student mental health problem. According to the research, Chinese students are the biggest international student group in the U.S. now (Wang, 2021). Moreover, all of our team members are part of the community which makes us more empathetic with this problem. We recognize that International students are facing a lot of serious issues socially, physically and mentally, such as emotional problems, academic stress, and so on. In a foreign country, students may need to face more unavoidable problems when they want to ask for help like cultural differences and language barriers. How do international students cope with different mental problems? We would like to make contributions for the group by information technology for Chinese international students to gain support. And we are trying our best to improve their mental health so that they can focus on better studying and a healthy lifestyle.
